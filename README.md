# Latencee - Network Latency Monitor

A terminal TUI application that measures and visualizes network latency to multiple servers with colorful indicators.

## Features

- Real-time latency monitoring to multiple servers
- Colorful status indicators:
  - ðŸŸ¢ Good (< 50ms)
  - ðŸŸ¡ Fair (50-150ms) 
  - ðŸ”´ Poor (150-500ms)
  - âš« Timeout (> 500ms or failed)
- Minimal dependencies using `smol` async runtime
- Cross-platform support (macOS and Linux)

## Usage

```bash
cargo run
```

### Building release version

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/latencee
```
